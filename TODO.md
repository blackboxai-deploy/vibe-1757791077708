# Snake Game Implementation TODO

## Development Steps

### ✅ Planning & Setup
- [x] Create comprehensive game plan with mechanics and requirements
- [x] Set up project structure and dependencies

### 🔨 Core Implementation
- [x] Create root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- [x] Create main game page (`src/app/page.tsx`) 
- [x] Implement Snake Game component (`src/components/SnakeGame.tsx`)
  - [x] Game state management (Menu → Playing → GameOver)
  - [x] Canvas rendering and game loop
  - [x] Snake entity with movement and growth
  - [x] Food spawning and collision detection

  - [x] Score system and progressive difficulty
  - [x] HUD with real-time stats
  - [x] Sound effects and visual feedback

### 🖼️ Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

### 🏗️ Build & Deploy
- [x] Install dependencies (`pnpm install`)
- [x] Build application (`pnpm run build --no-lint`)
- [x] Start production server (`pnpm start`)

### 🧪 Testing & Validation
- [x] Functional testing: Complete gameplay loop
- [x] Performance testing: 60fps maintenance, input responsiveness
- [x] Edge case testing: Collision detection, boundary limits
- [x] Cross-browser compatibility verification

### 🚀 Final Delivery
- [x] Generate preview URL for user testing
- [x] Provide game instructions and controls documentation
